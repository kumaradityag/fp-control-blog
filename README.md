# Duckietown Final Report

Created a template using quarto. Quarto is useful because we can publish to html, create a markdown, or get a pdf out fairly easily.

Install quarto using the instructions [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

To see a preview of this - clone the repo first and from the repo dir run

```bash
quarto preview
```

This should start showing the html version on some port. I'm still learning quarto by looking at the docs [here](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) - but lemme know if this doesn't work or if you have any other questions.

The main file to edit should be `index.qmd`.
