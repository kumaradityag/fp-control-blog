## Introduction

Here is some text. Quarto allows you to put things in the margins.

[This is a side note that will appear in the right margin.]{.aside}

## Analysis

We can place images or charts that span the full width or sit in the margin.

### Code Block

Because we enabled code folding, this big block won't clutter the page unless the user clicks "Show Code".

```{python}
import numpy as np

a = 1
b = 2
multiple = a * b

# Complex plotting code...
```
