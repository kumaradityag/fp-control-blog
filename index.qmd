abstract: "This project replaces the standard Duckietown lane following stack with a system that generates a local centerline trajectory. By tracking this path with a Pure Pursuit controller, the duckiebot achieves smoother navigation through curves and better resilience to noisy sensor data compared to previous PID-based approach."
