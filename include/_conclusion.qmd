This project successfully implemented a modular lane-following pipeline for the Duckiebot, moving away from the state estimation approach in favor of explicit trajectory generation and geometric path tracking. By leveraging robust polynomial fitting on ground-projected lane segments, we created a system capable of generating a centerline trajectory and following it using pure pursuit control.

Our experiments demonstrated that a pure pursuit controller, allows for continuous driving in both simulation and physical Duckietowns. While the transition from simulation to hardware introduced challenges regarding sensor noise and latency, the system proved that looking ahead at a generated path yields intuitive driving behavior. Our implementation also offers a flexible foundation for implementing more advanced planners and dynamic controllers in the future and general experimentation.

### Limitations

Although our pipeline performed well in simulation and achieved successful loops in real-world tests, the gap between simulation and reality exposed some weaknesses in both our trajectory generation and control algorithms.

#### Trajectory Generation Limitations

* **Single-Boundary Dependency:** Currently, the system fits a curve to either the white *or* the yellow lane markings, but does not fuse both simultaneously. This view of the road geometry creates instability: if the chosen boundary becomes sparse (but still above a given threshold) or occluded, the fit degrades immediately, even if the other boundary is clearly visible. A robust system could fit both boundaries jointly to maximize data utilization.
* **Model Constraints (The "S-Curve" Problem):** We model the lane as a quadratic polynomial. While robust for simple turns, a parabola cannot model inflection points (S-curves). If the vision horizon extends through a left-then-right turn, the quadratic fit will average the two curves into a straight line, causing the robot to drive off-road. Testing with a cubic polynomial in these situations might prove useful.

#### Pure Pursuit Limitations

Despite its computational efficiency, the pure pursuit controller exhibited some flaws when deployed on physical hardware:

* **Static Lookahead Sensitivity:** The controller is rigid; a fixed lookahead distance cannot handle both sharp corners (requires short lookahead) and straightaways (requires long lookahead) effectively. Without an adaptive lookahead based on curvature or speed, the robot oscillates on straights or cuts corners too aggressively.
* **Unmodeled Dynamics & Latency:** Pure pursuit assumes instantaneous kinematic response. It fails to account for the Duckiebot's system latency and tire slip at higher speeds. This sometimes results in a "reactive" driving style where the robot corrects errors only after they have accumulated, leading to jerky, oscillatory motion.
